# Welcome
You have just created a backstaged managed dev environment.
We use backstage to manage the Service Creation, cataloging, life cycle management and documentation for services based on golden path standards.

You now have a basic environment that you can build upon

## Things to note:
1. The backstage portal is your home for all things related to your service. Its a great place to live
2. Docs travel with your service. Docs relating to your service should be annotated in the `/doc` directory
3. CI/CD has been setup, you can connect to this directly form the backstage portal

## Lets Start
Now all the hard work is out of the way, you're free to do your thing. Code away!
